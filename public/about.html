<p>I see myself in one to three years learning more about coding and being able to leave the current role that I am in
  to pursue my dreams in coding. I have been working at car dealerships and car hire buisnesses for the past 2 years
  and have enjoyed them yet I feel like I can push myself to do more. Coding has always been a interest since I had left
  school and now i'm putting that into action because I know this is the best path for my future. It fits perfectly in the
  world I live in with technology growing so fast and I want to be a part of that. 
</p>

<p>I'm always working or studying so whenever I get the time I love going to the gym or playing some basketball with friends
  which is a great way for me to blow some steam so that I have a clear mindset once I get back to my coding. All in all I am
excited to see and become the future me. </p>
